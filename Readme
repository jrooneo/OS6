OSS Project 6

oss [processCount]
Where process count is between 1 and 18

Memory management now takes place. OSS creates different userProcess' that make random memory calls.
These calls are sent to OSS to handle which either finds the memory in a main memory array or creates the page in an open frame.
If no open frames then a non-referenced page is cleared out so that a new page can be entered.
Then the local array is mirrored to the shared table.

Problems:
Only output indiciates memory read and writes as they happen. No statistics are being calculated. Also leaks shared memory and signal handling is not proper.
